My name is **Haoxiang You(尤皓翔)**. I am a first Ph.D. student in the **Department of Mechanical Engineering and Material Sciences** at **Yale University**, advised by Professor [Ian Abraham](https://i-abr.github.io/). While I am broadly interested in robotics, my research primarily lies at the intersection of **Machine learning**, **Control Theory** and **Optimization**. I received my bachelor's degree in **Mechanical Engineering** from **Ningbo University** and my master's degree also in **Mechanical Engineering** at **University of Pennsylvania**, with **Outstanding Academic Award**

I enjoy computer games, DIY and cooking during my leisure time.
