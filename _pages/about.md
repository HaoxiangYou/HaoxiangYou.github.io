My name is **Haoxiang You (尤皓翔)**, and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at **Yale University**, advised by Professor [Ian Abraham](https://i-abr.github.io/). I am broadly interested in robotics, machine learning, control theory, and optimization. Currently, my research focuses on developing computationally efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for robot learning.

I earned my bachelor's degree from **Ningbo University**, and my master's degree from the **University of Pennsylvania**, where I received the Outstanding Academic Award. During my time at Penn, I had the opportunity to work with Professors [Michael Posa](https://dair.seas.upenn.edu/posa/) and [Pratik Chaudhari](https://pratikac.github.io/).

Outside of research, I enjoy playing computer games, DIY projects, and cooking.
