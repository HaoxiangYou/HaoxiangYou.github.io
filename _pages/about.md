My name is **Haoxiang You(尤皓翔)**. I am a first Ph.D. student in the **Department of Mechanical Engineering and Material Sciences** at **Yale University**, advised by Professor [Ian Abraham](https://i-abr.github.io/). While I am broadly interested in robotics, my research primarily lies at the intersection of **Machine learning**, **Control Theory** and **Optimization**.

Before I came to Yale, I did my master degree in the **Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics** at **University of Pennsylvania**. I was fortunate to work with Professor [Michael Posa](https://dair.seas.upenn.edu/) at **DAIRLab**. I won the **2023 SEAS Outstanding Academic Award**. I received my bachelor degree in **Mechanical Engineering** from **Ningbo University**.

I enjoy computer games, DIY and cooking during my leisure time.
